# FDI Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) trends in India over the years. The dataset contains FDI values for various sectors from 2000-01 to 2016-17. The analysis includes data preprocessing, data visualization, and exploring key insights using Python and relevant libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the file `FDI_in_India.csv`. It consists of the following columns:

- **Sector**: The different sectors for which FDI data is recorded.
- **2000-01 to 2016-17**: FDI values for each sector from 2000-01 to 2016-17.

## Project Files

The main files in this project are:

- `FDI_in_India.csv`: The raw dataset containing FDI values for various sectors.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run the data analysis code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualization)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fdi-analysis.git
cd fdi-analysis
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary dataset file (`fdi_data.csv`) in the project directory.

3. Open and run the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook .

4. The analysis code will preprocess the data, generate visualizations, and answer key questions about FDI trends in India.

## Results

The analysis results, insights, and visualizations can be found in the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook. The key findings are summarized and visualized to understand the FDI patterns across sectors and over the years.
